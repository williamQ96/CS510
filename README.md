## ðŸ‘» Gameplay Feature Summary

### âœ… Dot Product
We use the dot product to calculate the angle between the ghostâ€™s forward direction and the vector pointing toward the player.  
If the angle is within a certain range (i.e., the player is in front of the ghost), the ghost is able to see and chase the player.

### âœ… Linear Interpolation (Lerp)
Linear interpolation is used to smoothly rotate the ghost when the player moves behind it,  
creating a more natural turning behavior instead of an abrupt change in direction.

### âœ… Particle Effect
When the player holds **Left Shift** to sprint, the characterâ€™s movement speed increases by **3x**.  
During this sprint, a **particle effect** is triggered and follows the character, enhancing the sense of speed.

### âœ… Sound Effect
When the player is caught by a ghost, a **Sekiro-style death sound** is played,  
accompanied by a visual inspired by Sekiroâ€™s death screen.
